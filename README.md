# intelligent-scheduler

The Intelligent Scheduler is a python application that allows a user to create tasks on a calendar UI. It's most unique feature is that it has the ability to schedule tasks around your own schedule. Just set up a blacklist of times during the day that you don't want tasks to be scheduled (for example times when you are at work or sleeping) and then when you decide to add a new task, you can have the application decide the most optimal time to complete the task given it's due date, time and priority.

The file, run.py can be used to run the application so you can test its features.
